When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use remote repository when I want to share my work in case I am working in collaberation with a person or group to keep them updated after every logical commit.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might not want some work that might have been pushed by a collaberator to be pulled to my local without my knowledge.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is cloning one's repository into your own remote, cloning is getting a copy of a repository from remote to your local and branching means a different version of the project inside the same repository until merged.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
