When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use remote repository when I want to share my work in case I am working in collaberation with a person or group to keep them updated after every logical commit.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might not want some work that might have been pushed by a collaberator to be pulled to my local without my knowledge.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is cloning one's repository into your own remote, cloning is getting a copy of a repository from remote to your local and branching means a different version of the project inside the same repository until merged.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We can detect conflicts !

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Saving files, sharing them by either manually handing them over or uploading them to a cloud which is an easier way than manual. Then looking for changes manually or using diff on windows cmd. Would be a pain though!. Ofcourse git and github would be easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    WHen I am trying to add a new feature to my project without breaking up the main branch. It wont break the main branch in production.!
